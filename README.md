Automatically convert pictures in a directory as they are added and put the results in to a mirror directory.
For example:
- ./foo/bar.png is created or moved to this location
- It is then converted and copied to ./jpg/foo/bar.jpg (the source is untouched)
## Running
- Drag the target directory onto run.bat
## Running CLI
- Open a terminal in the program directory
- Run `run.bat path/to/target/directory` (you can also type `run.bat ` and drag the directory into the terminal to paste the path)
